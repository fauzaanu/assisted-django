# Assisted Django (GPT3/4)

I wrote this in a few hours to speed up my development, and it's not perfect but it works out for me. I will be
improving it over time.


### TODO

- [ ] Remove the markdown code comments that are generated by GPT-3
- [ ] Templates should also be created

### Your workflow to use this properly

1. **Install Django**: `pip install django`
2. **Create a Django Project**: `django-admin createproject Project`
3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: `cd Project`
4. **Create a New App**: `python manage.py startapp appname`
5. **Create a README.md or a textfile**: This file should contain a brief description of the project and its purpose.
   Try to highlight the database design in this file, and features.
6. **Create a .env file**: This file should contain the `OPENAI_API_KEY`
7. If the project is rather complex, overide the default model from gpt-3 to gpt-4.

##### Example of how to run this:

```python
from AssistedDjango.DjangoApplication import DjangoApplication


def enhance_django_app():
    app_name = "calorie_counter_app"  # replace with your actual Django app name
    app_directory = "Project/calorie_counter_app"  # replace with your actual Django app directory

    with open("caloriesapp.txt", "r") as f:  # Replace "README.md" with your actual README file
        purpose = f.read()

    django_app = DjangoApplication(app_name, purpose, app_directory)
    django_app.improve_app(cycles=1)  # Use enhance_django_app() instead of create_app()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    enhance_django_app()
```

what this script effectively does is take a look at the current files, compare with the objectives or project brief and
replace the content in the files.

`cycles` define how many times the script should run, it is possible overtime it improves.

Rightnow through simply prompting I could not get the responses to remove the markdown code comments, so you would have
to manually remove them.
